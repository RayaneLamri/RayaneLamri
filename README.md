## ü™ê My vocation
Hello I am a junior backend developer and my name is Rayane.

So far my journey through backend taugh me how fundamental it is to locate myself within this constallation of connections, servers and resquests. Assimilate key concepts and so being able to discern what is a key concept is what drives me. And this place is where I build stuff helping me to sharp my clairvoyance. 

## üî≠ My methodology

How do I proceed to do so ?

* Building projects made of primary features (Authentification, CRUD, Cookies, Authorization, ...)
* Deepen my understanding of OOP principles, design patterns and frameworks
* Enhance my works with PHP Standard Recommendation, Composer
* Learning PHP Frameworks, Laravel at the moment
