## ü™ê My vocation
Hello I am a junior backend developer and my name is Rayane. I am a PHP speaker.

So far my journey through backend taugh me how fundamental it is to locate myself within this constallation of connections, servers and resquests. Assimilate key concepts and so being able to discern what is a key concept is what drives me. And this place is where I build stuff helping me to sharp my clairvoyance. 

In other words I'm here to dig PHP until my shovel breaks and then keep digging.

## üî≠ My methodology

How do I proceed to do so ?

* Building projects made of primary features (like login/logout or CRUD)
* Practicing abstraction, polymorphism and all this OOP mystic for security purposes
* Enhance my works with PHP Standard Recommendation, PHPUnit, Composer
* Initiation to Laravel
