## 🪐 My vocation
Hello I am a junior backend developer and my name is Rayane.

So far my journey through backend taugh me how fundamental it is to locate myself within this constallation of connections, servers and requests. Assimilate key concepts and so being able to discern what is a key concept is what drives me. And this place is where I build features helping me to sharp my clairvoyance. 

## 🔭 My methodology

How do I proceed to do so ?

* Building projects made of basic features
  - Authentification
  - Authorization
  - CRUD
  - Caching
  - Cookies
* Deepen my understanding of OOP principles and of their conversion in design patterns 
* Enhance my works with the help of libraries, standard recommendations
* Mastering frameworks, Laravel at the moment
